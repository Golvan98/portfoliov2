# Backlog (Post-MVP)

No open questions. All decisions are locked in DECISIONS.md.

The following are deferred features — do NOT build these for MVP:

- Embed `public_activity` rows (currently excluded — noisy, low retrieval value)
- Add `/now` filtering by tag or search
- Admin UI for curated `portfolio_projects` entries (seed via SQL for MVP)
- Richer agent evals or reranking
- Multi-user workspaces
- Drag-and-drop between kanban columns (status change via `...` menu only for MVP)
- Mobile layout for `/myheadspace` (desktop-first for MVP)
- `/chat` dedicated page — PERMANENTLY OMITTED. Floating widget is the only agent UI surface.
